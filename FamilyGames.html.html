	<h1> Family & Friend Bonding Time </h1>
		
		<p>Earlier in this semester to a few weeks ago, I played with my family and friends in a game called amongus us. We would play for hours at night time having a blast! This is all due to among us rising in popularity during the start of fall. However, I had to buy them among us on steam so we would be able to play together. I do not regret spending my money for them, but I do regret buying monster hunter world for one of my cousins because we spent so much time grinding. In addition, we stopped playing among us which gave me the most enjoyable moments during this semseter. Hoping for more updates on among us, so we can all come back together to play this amazing game!</p>
